# michaels-helper-library.js

Why?
It's just a bunch of functions that I find useful.
It's in a format that makes sense to me (since I'm the creator).
It's fun to create.
It saves me time rather than fully writing out vanilla javascript.
It only includes the suff I know about.
Anything missing can be added once I understand it and implement it.
